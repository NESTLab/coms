# Test Data Notes

Default map for testing (`intel.txt`) is the 'difficult' scenario from the original Carpin et al. paper for Hough map merging.

`halmstad` contains collections of maps from https://github.com/saeedghsh/Halmstad-Robot-Maps. These will be used for more exhaustive experiments in our report, but not for continuous integration. 

Other folders contain data used for debugging issues which have come up in initial gmapping experiments.
